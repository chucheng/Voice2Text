# Voice2Text - Project Context

## Overview
macOS Menu Bar + Dock voice-to-text app built with SwiftUI + AVAudioEngine + whisper.cpp.
Shows in both the menu bar (MenuBarExtra) and the Dock.

## Tech Stack
- **UI**: SwiftUI MenuBarExtra (macOS 13+)
- **Audio**: AVAudioEngine with AVAudioConverter (resample to 16kHz mono Float32)
- **STT Engines**: whisper.cpp (offline) and Apple Speech Recognition (online, streaming)
- **Build**: xcodegen (`project.yml` → `.xcodeproj`)
- **Requirements**: macOS 14+, Xcode 15+
- **Sandbox**: App Sandbox enabled with audio-input + network-client entitlements

## Current Status: Dual STT Engine + Punctuation Restore
Full voice-to-text pipeline working with two engines:
- **Whisper**: record → resample → whisper inference → punctuation restore → script conversion → display
- **Apple Speech**: record → stream buffers → real-time recognition → script conversion → display

Models downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace to `~/Library/Application Support/Voice2Text/`.

### Punctuation Server
- Standalone BERT-based server for Chinese punctuation restoration
- Can run from source (`python scripts/punctuation_server.py`) or as packaged `.app`
- PyInstaller spec + build script in `scripts/` for packaging as `PunctuationServer.app`
- Models cached to `~/Library/Application Support/PunctuationServer/models/`
- Voice2Text auto-launches the server app if found in known locations
- `PunctuationClient.swift` handles health checks, restoration requests, and auto-launch

### Known Bugs
- **Dock icon click does not reopen main window**: `applicationShouldHandleReopen` IS called (confirmed via os_log), but the SwiftUI `Window` scene destroys the NSWindow on close. `canBecomeMain` finds no windows. `openWindow(id:)` is only available inside SwiftUI views, not from AppDelegate.
  - **Next approach to try**: Use a `@Published` flag on `AppState` set by AppDelegate, observed by a background/invisible SwiftUI view that calls `openWindow(id:)`, OR use `NSWindow` hiding instead of SwiftUI Window close.

## Architecture Notes
- `AppState` is the single source of truth, shared via `@EnvironmentObject`
- `AudioRecorder` is owned by `AppState` as a single instance — no duplicates
- `AudioRecorder` resamples mic input to 16kHz mono Float32 via `AVAudioConverter`
- `AudioRecorder` supports an optional `tapHandler` to forward raw buffers to Apple Speech
- `WhisperBridge` runs inference on a dedicated background `DispatchQueue`
- Whisper uses `language="auto"` for mixed Chinese+English speech
- If whisper outputs non-Chinese/English text (wrong language detection), auto-retries with `language="zh"`
- Apple Speech uses `zh-Hant` locale which handles mixed Chinese+English natively
- Apple Speech requires network — NWPathMonitor detects connectivity in real-time
- Post-processing pipeline: STT output → punctuation restore (optional) → Simplified/Traditional Chinese conversion
- Punctuation server auto-launched from `/Applications/`, `~/Applications/`, or bundle-adjacent location
- Script conversion uses Foundation `StringTransform` (`Hans-Hant` / `Hant-Hans`) — zero dependencies
- Model selection persisted via `UserDefaults`
- Models stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Voice2Text/`
- Available models: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3-turbo
- Transcription text is editable by the user after transcription
- Dev mode (off by default) shows debug log panel with timestamped entries
- LLM reformat feature exists in code but is greyed out (company proxy limitation)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Spacebar push-to-talk, Cmd+C copies full transcription (or selection if any)
- Punctuation restore enabled by default when server is available; greyed out when unavailable
- App icon: blue gradient with microphone, sound waves, text lines, "V2T" label

## Security
- Punctuation server: body size limit (1MB), text length limit (50K chars), ThreadingHTTPServer
- AnthropicClient: warns at runtime if ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL uses plaintext HTTP
- Debug logs redacted: only char counts logged, no transcription content
- Hardened Runtime enabled; entitlements minimal (sandbox + audio-input + network-client)
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Remaining accepted risks: localhost HTTP for punctuation IPC, no model checksum verification

## TODO (Next Steps)
1. **FIX: Dock icon reopen window** — see Known Bugs above; highest priority
2. **WAV Export** — write audio buffer to file for batch processing
3. **Global Hotkey** — add global keyboard shortcut for start/stop recording
4. **UI Redesign** — separate model management into Settings page, keep main view focused on record+transcribe+copy
5. **LLM Reformat** — re-enable when API access is available (currently blocked by company proxy)
6. **Model checksum** — add SHA-256 verification for downloaded whisper models

## Workflow Rules
- **Clarify before implementing**: when user input is ambiguous or unclear, do NOT guess — ask for clarification first and offer concrete options for the user to choose from.
- **Bug review before commit**: before any `git commit` + `git push`, perform a thorough bug review of all changed files (compilation, threading, SwiftUI lifecycle, API usage, edge cases). Only commit after confirming no issues.
- **When user says "bye"**: must perform these actions before ending:
  1. Update `CLAUDE.md` (reflect latest project status, progress, TODOs)
  2. Update `README.md` (sync latest status and TODOs)
  3. Thorough bug review of all code
  4. `git add` + `git commit` + `git push`

## Notes
- Use `xcodegen generate` to regenerate `.xcodeproj` — never hand-edit `.pbxproj`
- Custom Info.plist keys are defined in `project.yml` `info.properties` so they survive regeneration
- **Language preference**: all saved files (code, docs, CLAUDE.md, README.md) in **English**. Conversations with the user in **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**.
- whisper.cpp static libs built with CMake for arm64, Metal GPU acceleration enabled
- Linker warnings about macOS version mismatch (26.0 vs 14.0) are harmless
- Company brconnector proxy only allows CLI tools — native app HTTP calls return 404
